# Hello!

At the bottom there should be a footer with a background image, and there should be a favicon. Also, on this page, please enjoy some [Obama Ipsum](https://obamaipsum.com/).

It is that fundamental belief, it is that fundamental belief, I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that
makes this country work. This time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together,
and fight together, and bleed together under the same proud flag.

I'd been inspired by the civil rights movement - by all the clear-eyed, straight-backed, courageous young people who'd
boarded buses and traveled down South to march and sit at lunch counters, and lay down their lives in some cases for
freedom. We can play Reverend Wright's sermons on every channel, every day and talk about them from now until the
election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the American people think that I somehow believe or
sympathize with his most offensive words. We are a better country than this. A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud
auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard
as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Born into poverty? Pull yourself
up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots. But we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the
world we seek - a world where extremists no longer threaten our people, and American troops have come home; a world
where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peaceful
purposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all God's children are respected.

We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of
America. And that's what we have to restore. But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain
things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the
equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live
as you choose. Indeed, faith should bring us together.

Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.
